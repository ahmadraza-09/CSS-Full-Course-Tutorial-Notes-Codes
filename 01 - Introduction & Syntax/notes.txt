🟡 What is CSS?

    🔘CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets
    🔘CSS is the language we use to style a Web page.
    🔘CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media
    🔘CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once
    🔘External stylesheets are stored in CSS files

🟡 Why Use CSS?
    
    🔘CSS is used to define styles for your web pages, including the design, layout and variations in display for different devices and screen sizes.

    For example 

        body {
        background-color: lightblue;
        }

        h1 {
        color: white;
        text-align: center;
        }

        p {
        font-family: verdana;
        font-size: 20px;
        }

🟡 CSS Solved a Big Problem

    HTML was NEVER intended to contain tags for formatting a web page!
    HTML was created to describe the content of a web page, like:

    <h1>This is a heading</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph.</p>

    When tags like <font>, and color attributes were added to the HTML 3.2 specification, it started a nightmare for web developers. Development of large websites, where fonts and color information were added to every single page, became a long and expensive process.
    To solve this problem, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) created CSS.
    CSS removed the style formatting from the HTML page!

🟡 CSS Saves a Lot of Work!

    The style definitions are normally saved in external .css files.
    With an external stylesheet file, you can change the look of an entire website by changing just one file!

🟡 CSS Syntax

    🔘A CSS rule consists of a selector and a declaration block.
    🔘The selector points to the HTML element you want to style.
    🔘The declaration block contains one or more declarations separated by semicolons.
    🔘Each declaration includes a CSS property name and a value, separated by a colon.
    🔘Multiple CSS declarations are separated with semicolons, and declaration blocks are surrounded by curly braces.

    For example 

        p {
            color: red;
            text-align: center;
        }

        p is a selector in CSS (it points to the HTML element you want to style: <p>).
        color is a property, and red is the property value
        text-align is a property, and center is the property value
