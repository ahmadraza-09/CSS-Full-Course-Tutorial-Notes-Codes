🟡 CSS Units

    CSS has several different units for expressing a length.
    Many CSS properties take "length" values, such as width, margin, padding, font-size, etc.
    Length is a number followed by a length unit, such as 10px, 2em, etc.

    For example:

        h1 {
            font-size: 60px;
        }

        p {
            font-size: 25px;
            line-height: 50px;
        }

🟡 Absolute Lengths

    The absolute length units are fixed and a length expressed in any of these will appear as exactly that size.
    Absolute length units are not recommended for use on screen, because screen sizes vary so much. However, they can be used if the output medium is known, such as for print layout.

    For example:

    Unit	Description
    cm	    centimeters
    mm	    millimeters
    in	    inches (1in = 96px = 2.54cm)
    px*	    pixels (1px = 1/96th of 1in)
    pt	    points (1pt = 1/72 of 1in)
    pc	    picas (1pc = 12 pt)

    * Pixels (px) are relative to the viewing device. For low-dpi devices, 1px is one device pixel (dot) of the display. For printers and high resolution screens 1px implies multiple device pixels.

🟡 Relative Lengths

    Relative length units specify a length relative to another length property. Relative length units scale better between different rendering medium.

    For example:

    Unit	Description	
    em	    Relative to the font-size of the element (2em means 2 times the size of the current font)	
    rem	    Relative to font-size of the root element	
    vw	    Relative to 1% of the width of the viewport*	
    vh	    Relative to 1% of the height of the viewport*	
    %	    Relative to the parent element

🔴 Tip: The em and rem units are practical in creating perfectly scalable layout!
    * Viewport = the browser window size. If the viewport is 50cm wide, 1vw = 0.5cm.
