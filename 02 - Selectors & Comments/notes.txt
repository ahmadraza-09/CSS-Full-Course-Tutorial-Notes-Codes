游리 CSS Selectors

    A CSS selector selects the HTML element(s) you want to style.
    CSS selectors are used to "find" (or select) the HTML elements you want to style.

    We can divide CSS selectors into five categories:

    Simple selectors (select elements based on name, id, class)
    Combinator selectors (select elements based on a specific relationship between them)
    Pseudo-class selectors (select elements based on a certain state)
    Pseudo-elements selectors (select and style a part of an element)
    Attribute selectors (select elements based on an attribute or attribute value)
    This page will explain the most basic CSS selectors.

游리 The CSS element Selector

    The element selector selects HTML elements based on the element name.

    For example:

        p {
        text-align: center;
        color: red;
        }

游리 The CSS id Selector

    The id selector uses the id attribute of an HTML element to select a specific element.
    The id of an element is unique within a page, so the id selector is used to select one unique element!
    To select an element with a specific id, write a hash (#) character, followed by the id of the element.

    For example:

        #para1 {
        text-align: center;
        color: red;
        }

    游댮 Note: An id name cannot start with a number!

游리 The CSS class Selector

    The class selector selects HTML elements with a specific class attribute.
    To select elements with a specific class, write a period (.) character, followed by the class name.

    For example:

        .center {
        text-align: center;
        color: red;
        }

    For example2:

        p.center {
        text-align: center;
        color: red;
        }

游리 The CSS Universal Selector

    The universal selector (*) selects all HTML elements on the page.

    For example:

        * {
        text-align: center;
        color: blue;
        }

游리 The CSS Grouping Selector

    The grouping selector selects all the HTML elements with the same style definitions.
    Look at the following CSS code (the h1, h2, and p elements have the same style definitions):

    For example:

        h1 {
        text-align: center;
        color: red;
        }

        h2 {
        text-align: center;
        color: red;
        }

        p {
        text-align: center;
        color: red;
        }
    
    It will be better to group the selectors, to minimize the code.
    To group selectors, separate each selector with a comma.

        h1, h2, p {
        text-align: center;
        color: red;
        }

游리 CSS Comments

    CSS comments are not displayed in the browser, but they can help document your source code.
    Comments are used to explain the code, and may help when you edit the source code at a later date.
    Comments are ignored by browsers.
    A CSS comment is placed inside the <style> element, and starts with /* and ends with */:

    For example:

        /* This is a single-line comment */
        p {
        color: red;
        }
    
    You can add comments wherever you want in the code:

        p {
        color: red;  /* Set text color to red */
        }

    Even in the middle of a code line:

        p {
        color: /*red*/blue; 
        }
    
    Comments can also span multiple lines: 

        /* This is
        a multi-line
        comment */

        p {
        color: red;
        }

游리 HTML and CSS Comments

    From the HTML tutorial, you learned that you can add comments to your HTML source by using the <!--...--> syntax.
    In the following example, we use a combination of HTML and CSS comments:
    
    For example:

        <!DOCTYPE html>
        <html>
        <head>
        <style>
        p {
        color: red; /* Set text color to red */
        }
        </style>
        </head>
        <body>

        <h2>My Heading</h2>

        <!-- These paragraphs will be red -->
        <p>Hello World!</p>
        <p>This paragraph is styled with CSS.</p>
        <p>CSS comments are not shown in the output.</p>

        </body>
        </html>
