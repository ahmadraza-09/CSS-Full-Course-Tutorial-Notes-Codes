游리 CSS Opacity / Transparency

    The opacity property specifies the opacity/transparency of an element.

    The opacity property can take a value from 0.0 - 1.0. The lower the value, the more transparent:

    For example:

        img {
            opacity: 0.5;
        }

游리 Transparent Hover Effect

    The opacity property is often used together with the :hover selector to change the opacity on mouse-over:

    For example:

        img {
            opacity: 0.5;
        }

        img:hover {
            opacity: 1.0;
        }

游리 CSS Navigation Bar

游리 Navigation Bars

    Having easy-to-use navigation is important for any web site.

    With CSS you can transform boring HTML menus into good-looking navigation bars.

游리 Navigation Bar = List of Links

    A navigation bar needs standard HTML as a base.

    In our examples we will build the navigation bar from a standard HTML list.

    A navigation bar is basically a list of links, so using the <ul> and <li> elements makes perfect sense:

    For example:

        <ul>
            <li><a href="default.asp">Home</a></li>
            <li><a href="news.asp">News</a></li>
            <li><a href="contact.asp">Contact</a></li>
            <li><a href="about.asp">About</a></li>
        </ul>
