游리 The float Property

    The float property is used for positioning and formatting content e.g. let an image float left to the text in a container.

    The float property can have one of the following values:

    left - The element floats to the left of its container
    right - The element floats to the right of its container
    none - The element does not float (will be displayed just where it occurs in the text). This is default
    inherit - The element inherits the float value of its parent
    In its simplest use, the float property can be used to wrap text around images.

    For example:

        img {
            float: right;
        }

游리 The clear Property

    When we use the float property, and we want the next element below (not on right or left), we will have to use the clear property.

    The clear property specifies what should happen with the element that is next to a floating element.

    The clear property can have one of the following values:

    none - The element is not pushed below left or right floated elements. This is default
    left - The element is pushed below left floated elements
    right - The element is pushed below right floated elements
    both - The element is pushed below both left and right floated elements
    inherit - The element inherits the clear value from its parent

    For example:

        div1 {
            float: left;
        }

        div2 {
            clear: left;
        }

游리 The display: inline-block Value

    Compared to display: inline, the major difference is that display: inline-block allows to set a width and height on the element.

    Also, with display: inline-block, the top and bottom margins/paddings are respected, but with display: inline they are not.

    Compared to display: block, the major difference is that display: inline-block does not add a line-break after the element, so the element can sit next to other elements.

    The following example shows the different behavior of display: inline, display: inline-block and display: block:

    span.a {
        display: inline; /* the default for span */
        width: 100px;
        height: 100px;
        padding: 5px;
        border: 1px solid blue;
        background-color: yellow;
    }

    span.b {
        display: inline-block;
        width: 100px;
        height: 100px;
        padding: 5px;
        border: 1px solid blue;
        background-color: yellow;
    }

    span.c {
        display: block;
        width: 100px;
        height: 100px;
        padding: 5px;
        border: 1px solid blue;
        background-color: yellow;
    }

游리 Using inline-block to Create Navigation Links

    One common use for display: inline-block is to display list items horizontally instead of vertically. The following example creates horizontal navigation links:

    For example:

        .nav {
            background-color: yellow;
            list-style-type: none;
            text-align: center; 
            padding: 0;
            margin: 0;
        }

        .nav li {
            display: inline-block;
            font-size: 20px;
            padding: 20px;
        }
