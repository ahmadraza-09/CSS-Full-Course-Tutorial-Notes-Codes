游리 The z-index Property

    When elements are positioned, they can overlap other elements.
    The z-index property specifies the stack order of an element (which element should be placed in front of, or behind, the others).
    An element can have a positive or negative stack order:

    For example:

        img {
            position: absolute;
            left: 0px;
            top: 0px;
            z-index: -1;
        }

游리 The overflow property specifies whether to clip the content or to add scrollbars when the content of an element is too big to fit in the specified area.

    The overflow property has the following values:

    visible - Default. The overflow is not clipped. The content renders outside the element's box
    hidden - The overflow is clipped, and the rest of the content will be invisible
    scroll - The overflow is clipped, and a scrollbar is added to see the rest of the content
    auto - Similar to scroll, but it adds scrollbars only when necessary

游댮 Note: The overflow property only works for block elements with a specified height.

游리 CSS Layout - Overflow

    The CSS overflow property controls what happens to content that is too big to fit into an area.

游리 overflow: visible

    By default, the overflow is visible, meaning that it is not clipped and it renders outside the element's box:

    For example:

        div {
            width: 200px;
            height: 65px;
            background-color: coral;
            overflow: visible;
        }

游리 overflow: hidden

    With the hidden value, the overflow is clipped, and the rest of the content is hidden:

    For example:

        div {
            overflow: hidden;
        }

游리 overflow: scroll

    Setting the value to scroll, the overflow is clipped and a scrollbar is added to scroll inside the box. Note that this will add a scrollbar both horizontally and vertically (even if you do not need it):

    For example:

        div {
            overflow: scroll;
        }

游리 overflow: auto
    
    The auto value is similar to scroll, but it adds scrollbars only when necessary:

    For example:

        div {
            overflow: auto;
        }

游리 overflow-x and overflow-y

    The overflow-x and overflow-y properties specifies whether to change the overflow of content just horizontally or vertically (or both):

    overflow-x specifies what to do with the left/right edges of the content.
    overflow-y specifies what to do with the top/bottom edges of the content.

    For example:

        div {
            overflow-x: hidden; /* Hide horizontal scrollbar */
            overflow-y: scroll; /* Add vertical scrollbar */
        }
